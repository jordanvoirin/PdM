This master thesis treats one of the major challenges in astronomy and in optics in general, the aberrations and their corrections. We will study and develop a method to identify the static aberrations present in an  optical system using the data produced by it.

Ground based observation is as old as the first men. But since the Galilei Galileo telescope in 1609, the resolution power of the telescopes is far greater. Many inventions lead to the construction of the largest telescope ever built, the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Now that we are able to build enormous telescopes with mirror diameter up to 8m, soon to be bitten by the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) with its 18m primary mirror diameter, the limitation of the resolution is not the diameter anymore, but the inhomogeneities of the Earth's atmosphere. Indeed, the turbulence present in the atmosphere creates a turbulent distribution of refractive index due to the distribution of temperature principally. This alters the optical path of the light through the atmosphere which finally deteriorates the images given by the telescope.

In the 1980's, systems to correct aberrations in telescopes called an active optics system were developed. It consists of actuators placed under the telescope mirrors capable of correcting the telescope deformation due to the effect of wind, temperature, gravity, vibration, etc... Those systems works at  around 1 Hz , which is not fast enough to correct for the turbulence of the atmosphere (100-1000 Hz) but they are essential in the construction of large telescopes. The state-of-the-art technique is the adaptive optics, developed to take into account the effects of the atmosphere. This technique monitors the aberrations present in the wavefront and corrects them in real time. The schema of principle is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ao_scheme}. It uses a wavefront sensor to characterize its deformation and then passes the information to a deformable mirror to correct it. It is called an adaptive optic loop. It works well, but the drawback of this method is that it does not correct the aberrations up to the scientific detector. Those uncorrected aberrations are called Non-Common Path Aberration (NCPA), they are generally static or slowly evolving over time. The adaptive optic also requires a complex optical system before the scientific detector. The beam is split in two parts. One arm goes to the scientific detector and the other is used in the adaptive optic loop.

We present here a method called phase diversity that uses images of the scientific detector to deduct the aberrations present in the wavefront. In our case, the phase diversity is used to correct the static aberrations that deform the wavefront. Our work is inspired by the phase diversity idea that was first introduced by \citet{Gonsalves_1982}. The idea is to use one focused and one defocused image to retrieve the aberrations. Two images at least are needed due to the property of light acquisition. There is an indetermination, because the detector is only sensitive to the intensity of light and not the light wave itself. This indetermination is raised adding a phase diversity. Unlike adaptive optic system, the phase diversity requires nearly no additional optical component depending on how it is implemented. The final aim of this project would be to integrate the developed phase diversity into the design of the DAG (Dogu Anadolu Gozlemevi) telescope in Turkey, see Figure \ref{fig:DAGtelescope}.

This report is organized in three main chapters. First, a review of the necessary theoretical background is reminded, going from the scalar theory of diffraction to the description of phase retrievals methods. Then we present an experiment performed at the optic laboratory at HEIG-VD. The ONERA (Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales) algorithm of phase diversity is tested and used in comparison with a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. And finally, the development of an analytical phase diversity algorithm is presented and tested with simulated Point Spread Functions (PSFs).
