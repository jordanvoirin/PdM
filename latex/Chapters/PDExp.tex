\label{ch:PDExp}

Here, we will describe the experiment put in place in the optical laboratory at the HEIG-VD to reconstruct wavefronts with unknown static aberrations introduced using phase screens. At first, we study the  behaviour of the phase diversity algorithm put in place by \citet{mugnier_2006} at ONERA with respect to number of averaging images, in other words noise level, and number of Zernike coefficients retrieved. Then we test the algorithm using a known aberration introduced by a parallel plane plate in the beam comparing the result to Zemax simulation. And finally, we introduce the phase screen to have random aberrations in the pupil and try to compare the phase diversity results with the Shack Hartman wavefront sensor results.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The design of the experiment was already done by \citet{Bouxin_PDM}. The system is built according to her plans and specifications. Figure \ref{fig:setupSchema} shows the schema of the experimental setup.

The experiment is mounted on a pressurized legs optical table. The assembly contains six main components : a light source, an entrance pupil, an imaging system, a converging lens to focus the beam on the camera, a camera and a wavefront sensor.

\subsection{Light source}
\label{subsec:LigthSource}

\label{fig:WFdistantSource}
\end{wrapfigure}

The final application of the phase diversity will be to characterize the optical aberrations induced by the imperfect optical path to a scientific detector of a telescope. For this reason, the light source has to simulate a distant star aberration-free wavefront. A distant star wavefront is considered planar since the object distance, z, is far greater than the telescope size, r, see Fig. \ref{fig:WFdistantSource}. The source of our experiment must then be characterized by a planar wavefront.

In order to obtain such a planar wavefront at the entrance pupil, the light source consist of a "pigtailed laser diode", a f=11mm converging lens, a pinhole and a f=200 mm converging lens, see Table \ref{tab:optComp}. The pigtailed laser diode emits a Gaussian beam centred at 637.5 nm slightly diverging. The converging lens concentrates the beam at the center of the 10$\mu$m pinhole to filter the noise. The second converging lens collimates the beam, obtaining a collimated beam with a planar wavefront, see Fig. \ref{fig:sourceRayTracing} and \ref{fig:pinholeEffect}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Entrance pupil}
\label{subsec:EntrancePupil}

The entrance pupil of our optical system is a circular aperture of 3.2 mm diameter placed after the collimating lens of the light source. It is milled in a metal plate and centred in his support, to avoid positioning with a XY table. The diameter is chosen in available material to fit in the different detector's surfaces.

\subsection{Pupil imaging system}
\label{subsec:pupilImSystem}

The phase diversity technique requires PSFs images as input, which means that the beam as to be focused onto the detector surface. To analyse the aberration in the pupil plane, one needs to focus an image of the beam passing through the entrance pupil. The simplest assembly to achieve this goal is the 4F system, which consist of two converging lenses of focal 100 mm. The two lenses are separated by 200 mm, see Fig. \ref{fig:setupSchema}. This places the image of the entrance pupil 100 mm after the second converging lens.

\subsection{Detectors}
\label{subsec:Detectors}

The image of the entrance pupil, obtained with the 4F system, is focused onto a CMOS Ximea camera by a f = 80 mm converging lens to acquire the PSFs for the phase diversity wavefront retrieval. The camera has a surface composed by 1280x1024 pixels of 5.3 $\mu$m, see Appendix \ref{app:ximeaCam}. It is mounted on sliding support in order to be able to acquire in/out-of-focus images. A beam splitter is placed in the converging beam to separate it in two. The second beam is collimated and a Shack-Hartman WFS is placed on the entrance pupil image plane, to check the results of the phase diversity wavefront retrieval. The Shack-Hartman WFS has a 39 X 31 lenslets grid and a CCD with a resolution of 1280x1024 pixels of 4.65 $\mu$m, see Appendix \ref{app:SHwfs}.

\section{Data Acquisition}
\label{sec:DataAcquis}

\subsection{Ximea Camera}
\label{subsec:acquisXimCam}

The ONERA algorithm takes at least one focused and one defocused PSFs, as described in section \ref{subsec:OneraAlgoImp}. The PSFs are acquired using a python script which uses an open-source library to control the ximea camera, \verb|pyXimea|\footnote{\url{https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyximea}}, available on GitHub. The acquisition is done following these steps : 

\begin{enumerate}

\item The first step in order to acquire PSFs is to determine the position of the camera's focus point using the python script \verb|AlignementScriptXimeaCamera.py|, see Appendix \ref{subapp:AlignementScriptXimeaCamera}. This script let's you acquire consecutively PSFs at different camera's positions and computes their FWHM. It finally returns the minimum FWHM and the camera's position, see Figure \ref{subfig:28092017AlignementXimeaPSFs} and \ref{subfig:28092017AlignementXimeaPos}.

    \end{subfigure}
    \decoRule
    \caption{Example of the results of an alignment procedure}
\end{figure}

\item Once the focus point position of the camera is determined, the acquisition of the data is possible. The acquisition script is called \verb!AcquisAndSaveXimea.py!, see Appendix \ref{subapp:AcquisAndSaveXimea}.

\item The user needs to set the main parameters before acquiring. They are the number of images on which to average, the size of the final PSFs, the position of the focus point on the sliding system and the initial guess to fit the 2D Gaussian on the PSF to find its center. The initial guess can be made using the Ximea camera software, called \verb!xiCamTool!, with which one gets a live feedback of the camera.

\item Then the running program ask the user what he needs to do after having made a sound. The first thing the user needs to do is to place the camera at the focus point and turn on the LED in order to set the optimal exposure time in order to avoid saturation.

\item Finally the acquiring sequence begins, the program ask the user to shut down and turn on the source as the user acquire the different images to get the dark images and the PSF images. The user needs to manually displace the camera to get the defocused PSFs. The program computes the positions to get a $2\pi$ P2V defocus dephasing.

\end{enumerate}

Many functions, used in the two scripts described above, are coded in the script \verb!functionsXimea.py!, see Appendix \ref{subapp:functionsXimea}.

\subsection{Shack-Hartmann WFS}
\label{subsec:acquisSHwfs}

The Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor acquisition is done with the company software. The acquired data are the Zernike coefficients and the reconstructed wavefront computed following the principle described in section \ref{subsec:SHprinciple}. Their is a few parameters that the user can set : the exposure time (there is also an auto set), the number of averaging images (1 up to 300) and the points reference of the detector. 

The data are saved manually in a \textit{.csv} file. I coded an IDL script to read and average the Shack-Hartmann data, in order to be able to analyse them and compare the result with the phase diversity, see Appendix \ref{subapp:readAndAverageSHdata} and \ref{subapp:readSHWFSdata}. 

\section{Results}
\label{sec:Results}

This section presents the results of the phase diversity experiment, with the introduction of different sources of aberration. We will first present the results of the ONERA algorithm test, then we will compare the phase diversity retrieval with a calibrated aberration and finally we will introduce random static aberration with the phase screen and compare the results to the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor results.

\subsection{ONERA Phase Diversity test}
\label{subsec:ONERAPDtest}

The motivation of this test was to better understand the behaviour of the ONERA phase diversity algorithm with respect to the different parameters that could influence its results, such as the noise present in the PSFs, the number of Zernike coefficients returned for the modal mode and the error on the defocused distance of the PSFs.

\caption{Noise level as a function of the number of averaging images acquired with $\sim$ 300 $\mu$s exposition time. The noise level is computed as the mean of the standard deviation of every pixel divided by the maximum of the focused PSF.}
\label{fig:NoiseCurve}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The Ximea detector has a noise curve visible in Figure \ref{fig:NoiseCurve}. The noise curve is computed with the noise level of the focused PSFs. It follows an exponential law with the number of averaging images. The noise level varies from $\sim 1\mathrm{e}-3$ to $\sim 8\mathr{e}-5$, for 10 and 5000 images respectively. Having the noise curve of the detector, we can study empirically how it influences the phase diversity results.



\subsection{Parallel plane plate}
\label{subsec:ParPlanePlate}

The first source of aberration studied in this work is a tilted parallel plane plate which is used as a calibrated source of astigmatism.
