  abstract =  {Phase retrieval implies extraction of the phase of a complex signal f from its modulus {\textbar}f{\textbar}. We give examples where an additional constraint is imposed: knowledge of the modulus of F, the Fourier transform of f. The retrieval is accomplished by computer processing of samples of {\textbar}f{\textbar} and {\textbar}F{\textbar}. The problems of noisy data and nonuniqueness are addressed.},
