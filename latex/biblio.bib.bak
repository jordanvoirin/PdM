  abstract = {For large telescopes, the fundamental limit set by the diffraction to the angular resolution can be reached if the aberrations are perfectly corrected. Two solutions are practicable: image restoration by numerical processing or real time correction by adaptive optics. These two processes require the determination of the wavefront or of the optical transfer function. New large detectors arrays can be used in wavefront sensing which then allow the measurement of the wavefront at a large number of point. The general lay-out of such an instrument is given and its accuracy evaluated. The wavefront sensing contribution to numerical image processing is studied mainly for the case of degradation by atmospheric turbulence. The improvement of numerical processing by a partial active correction is discussed.},

  abstract =  {The problem of reconstructing an unknown light source from measurements of the modulus of the correlation function of the optical field has been investigated experimentally. The practical feasibility of two different techniques is compared. The first method involves the introduction of a reference point source to the side of the unknown source. The second method depends upon the use of filters with exponential response functions in front of the source. Both methods permit the source to be reconstructed from measurements of the modulus alone. The latter technique involves more-sophisticated numerical procedures. Both methods have the advantage that the recovered phase is largely independent of the instrumental transfer function.},

Expressions for the log-likelihood function and its gradient are presented for the case of Poisson noise. An expectation-maximization algorithm that enforces a nonnegativity constraint in a natural fashion is constructed for use in the Poisson noise case.},
