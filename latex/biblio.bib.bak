We give examples where an additional constraint is imposed: knowledge of the modulus of F, the Fourier transform of f. The retrieval is accomplished by computer processing of samples of {\textbar}f{\textbar} and {\textbar}F{\textbar}. The problems of noisy data and nonuniqueness are addressed.},

  abstract =  {The problem of reconstructing an unknown light source from measurements of the modulus of the correlation function of the optical field has been investigated experimentally. The practical feasibility of two different techniques is compared. The first method involves the introduction of a reference point source to the side of the unknown source. The second method depends upon the use of filters with exponential response functions in front of the source. Both methods permit the source to be reconstructed from measurements of the modulus alone. The latter technique involves more-sophisticated numerical procedures. Both methods have the advantage that the recovered phase is largely independent of the instrumental transfer function.},
